A place to keep general purpose config files.

Here's how to include in your local config files:
       gitconfig (requires git >= 1.7.10)
                [include]
                        path = configs/gitconfig
       
       bashrc
                source ~/configs/bashrc

       ssh_config
                Sadly, there is currently no way to do this :(

       init.el
                (load "~/configs/init.el")
